# Mern-Book-Engine

## Description 
AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase

This app was an originally a starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and I refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.
